Shiba Inu was chosen for analysis. Time period: October 23-13, 2021.

Shiba Inu was created in August 2020 by an anonymous entity dubbed "Ryoshi".
Some notable events related to SHIB(Token ticker) include a 50 trillion ($1 billion valuation at the time) donation to the India COVID crypto relief fund, 
as well as $665 million value donation to the Future of Life Institute.

In October 2021, there was a suspiciously high increase in the value of SHIB, with records showing almost a 240% increase in its value. This was immediately followed by a 
drastic drop at the beginning of November until the end of the month, losing 55% of its value.

On October 23, SHIB was $0.000028, and by October 28, it was $0.000088. This roughly translates to a 200% increase in value.
Interestingly, trading volume also spiked alongside the price rally, reaching $40B.

Using a 7-day rolling baseline, SHIB’s daily volumes during Oct 27–29 were 5–7σ above average, which is statistically extreme.
These spikes coincided with retail hype on social media and rumours of Robinhood listing SHIB, suggesting news-synchronised pump dynamics.
Within two weeks of hitting its ATH, SHIB corrected nearly 40%, a pattern resembling a pump-and-dump cycle where early entrants and large holders take profits while retail demand wanes.
The strongest anomaly occurred on Nov 2–3, where volumes surged again but price failed to reclaim highs — a classic distribution signal

Concentration: Back then, the top 10 SHIB wallets controlled around 62% of the total supply (according to Etherscan). Even if we leave out the burn wallet, it’s clear that a few big holders still had a lot of power over the market.
Exchange inflows: Data from Etherscan and Dune shows that between Oct 27–29, a lot of SHIB was being sent into exchange wallets. This usually means that whales were preparing to cash out while retail demand was peaking.
Distribution pattern: Looking at the transfers more closely, we can see that some wallets sent billions of SHIB tokens to exchanges right in the middle of the rally. This could suggest that the selling wasn’t random, but rather coordinated by large holders.
